I remember getting off the bus, and before I could even get my luggage set up somewhere I noticed her stand out amongst a group of folk unloading a box truck. She stood there tall, organizing everyone. I had happened to wear a snapback of a group I was previously in, which she recognized. She came and talked to me and from there I spent the entire summer looking for her attention. Later on, we got married during the pandemic after a very long distance relationship, and decided to always be by each others side. Thank you to my wife for everything.",

In 2021, the team trusted me and my friend Bibi Dang to lead the entire group as executive directors as we headed into the uncertain age of Covid and had to reinvent everything in a virtual enviornment.",
